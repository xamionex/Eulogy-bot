When entering a new stage, there is a 5% (+5% per stack) chance for each item generated in the stage to be replaced with a random lunar item instead. This affects items in Chests, 3D Printers, Void Cradles, Void Potential Orbs, Rusted/Encrusted Lockboxes, the teleporter reward, and the Cauldrons in the Bazaar Between Time. It also affects any item dropped while the Artifact of Sacrifice is enabled.
